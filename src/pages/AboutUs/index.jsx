                    <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
                    <span>
                        <p>In 2021, while running a public gaming lounge in Southwest Nigeria, Chidi Nkwocha (founder, Gamehauz Inc.), ran into two problems. Low visibility, one. Next, keen customers who couldn’t afford the luxury of waiting to use a facility were leaving, unhappy.</p>
                        <p> He conceived an idea. Why not create a seamless playtime experience in which public recreation facility users can eliminate waiting time with one-click ticket reservation at home, while also assisting recreation businesses in increasing visibility, boosting sales and improving customer retention?</p>
                        <p>And so, Pentria was born - a lovable product by a team of game, event and tech enthusiasts passionate about solving social and business development problems in Africa.</p>
